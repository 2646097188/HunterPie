The Abnormality Tray widget allows you to track your buff and debuff durations, it's useful when playing Hunting Horn, or when you just want to know how long a certain buff will last. HunterPie lets you create as many trays as you want, allowing you to separate abnormalities in different trays.

> Keep in mind the more widgets you have on your screen, the more it impacts performance.

## Creating a new tray

To create a new tray, open HunterPie's settings in the `Abnormality Trays` tab and click on the <ion-icon name="add-circle"/>, in case you want to delete a specific tray, click on the <ion-icon name="remove-circle"></ion-icon>, it will prompt you with a confirmation so you can delete the tray.

> If you're creating new bars while the game is running, you'll have to restart HunterPie in order for it to visually create the bar widget.

## Configuring the tray

To configure your new tray, click on the <ion-icon name="settings-sharp"/>. It will open a new window that lets you configure all the tray settings individually.
