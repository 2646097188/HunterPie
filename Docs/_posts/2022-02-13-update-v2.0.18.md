HunterPie v2.0.18 brings some new features and fixes.

## Abnormality Trays
Abnormality Trays are bars that track and display your character's buff and debuff timers, they can be used in case you want to know how long your Hunting Horn buff will last, for example.

As of now, HunterPie supports the following categories for buffs, not all of the buffs are supported, but they will be added whenever possible:

- Songs
- Consumables (this also includes environment buffs)
- Debuffs
- Gear skills
- Food skills

Refer to the [Abnormality Tray](/posts/abnormality-tray-widget) for more information.
